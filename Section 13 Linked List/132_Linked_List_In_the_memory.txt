arrays are contiguous in memory meaning right next to each other.

Linked list are anywhere in memory because each node stores the location of the next node.

This allows us to add as many nodes to a linked list as we want because we just make the final node in the linked 
list (current tail) point to your new node and make the new final node your tail.
