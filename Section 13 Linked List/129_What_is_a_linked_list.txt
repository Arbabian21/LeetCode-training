Linked List is a form of sequential colelciton and it does not have to be in order (in memory). 
A linked list is made of independent nodes that may contain any type of data and each node has a 
reference to the next node in the link.

kind of like a train where each car is a node and the cars are connected with links. 
They also both have heads and tails.
You must traverse all nodes/train-cars to get to the end.
Each node has two parts, data and links to the next node. i.e. passengers and links to the next car.

Nodes of linked list are NOT contiguous in memory. 

Every linked list has a head node that then points to the first node. the purpose is litterally just 
to be a starting point.

Each node has the data it stores and the memory location of the next node.

Each tail has the data it stores and points to the null memory location.
The reason you have access to tail, you are able to very quickly add new nodes to the end of the list. Otherwise
would have to go through every node in the linked list to add one to the end which is O(n)
